# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What motivated me to do this project was knowing that this is the first stepping stone to coding. Learning and understanding how to do this will help me futher my knowledge in coding.
- I wanted to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible in order to make the website more accessible to different viewers.
- Working on this project helped me learn the difference between semantic and non-semantic HTML codes. It's much easier to read code when semantic elements are used.
